The calculator app is an app I made from Processing java, finished in 3 days and first programmed on Eclipse. 

7/19/2018
Release v.1.0.1
The app consists of numbers, *, +, ^, %(modulus), -, =, and . (Working)
I have yet to add +/-, âˆš, trigonometry, %(percent)
I also plan on making it easier, more efficient, and reduce the lrge amount of repeated code that there is already with the current method.
Finishing touches will include 
	making the colors and design more professional, higher quality,
	mouse hover making the button display change in some way

Release v1.1.2
The app calculations are now refactored to be called from a single method in the Operation class
This app uses regular expressions
	There are now negatives
	Resolved issue with text repeating
	When there are supposed to be errors, the program simply doesn't try to do the operation because the expression isn't valid
The less precision is still a problem even though the floats are not 
Overall, the app is much easier to code, use, and update
