Geometric Calculator is a calculator app programmed in Java using the Scanner library that helps the user find the area of certain 2D shapes.

In the next release, I will give you 3-D shapes. Calculate the surface area and volume of any 3-D shapes and get a choice every shape yuo do for 2-D and 3-D. Then, if it is 2-D, you are asked for perimeter or area. If it is 3-D that you chose, you are asked for volume or surface area. The developer's perks to the next update are presumably a new class, and lots of methods and instances to go along with it. There is a lot of code that has been repeasting, and my plans are to make it more DRY. This will be a major update.
