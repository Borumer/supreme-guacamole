<p>I store all my Java and JavaScript on here. Feel free to look at it and collaborate. The project is made up of multiple files, so each project file has a designated folder containing the prject file, the class(if needed), and an about.txt file talking about what it does.</p>
<p>This project is useful because there are some apps that can be used in daily life that haven&#39;t been made before. </p>
<p>To get started, take a look at the code of conduct. To run the program, run any of the files individually, unless they are in a folder, in which case all files in a folder must be put in a folder and run.</p>
<p>Get help with the project by posting an issue, refering to the project github supreme-guacamole wiki, or contacting me (if no other options work).</p>
<p>I, Varun, maintain the project. I have gotten some from Id Tech Summer Camp courses and others from Codeacademy. </p>
