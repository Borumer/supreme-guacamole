# supreme-guacamole
I store all my Java and JavaScript on here. Feel free to look at it and collaborate. The project is made up of multiple files, so each project file has a designated folder containing the prject file, the class(if needed), and an about.txt file talking about what it does.

This project is useful because there are some apps that can be used in daily life that haven't been made before. 

To get started, take a look at the code of conduct. To run the program, run any of the files individually, unless they are in a folder, in which case all files in a folder must be put in a folder and run.

Get help with the project by posting an issue, refering to the project github supreme-guacamole wiki, or contacting me (if no other options work).

I, Varun, maintain the project. I have gotten some from Id Tech Summer Camp courses and others from Codeacademy.
