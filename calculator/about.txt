The calculator app is an app I made from processing java, finished in 3 days and first programmed on Eclipse. 

7/19/2018
The app consists of numbers, *, +, ^, %(modulus), -, =, and . (Working)
I have yet to add +/-, âˆš, trigonometry, %(percent)
I also plan on making it easier, more efficient, and reduce the lrge amount of repeated code that there is already with the current method.
Finishing touches will include 
	making the colors and design more professional, higher quality,
	mouse hover making the button display change in some way
